# MemoryGame

Hey and welcome! Here is a very simple Memory Game. 
Let me give you some informations. We can choose with how many cards we wa&nt to play (16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 cards). Then, we just need to click the 'Generate grid' button to generate the grid. Once the grid is generate, we count the number of trials we need to solve the grid. At any moment, it is also possible to stop the game and generate a new grid.
